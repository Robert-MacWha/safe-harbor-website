note: "During transaction #2, c0ffeebabe paid a bribe of ~678.88 ETH to beaverbuilder who 
  in turn paid the funds to Lido. As far as I'm aware, Lido has not returned any of these 
  funds to the victims. According to various reports 
  (https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/05/24/tensions-rise-between-sushiswap-lido-over-return-of-exploited-funds) 
  there were several DAO proposals which all failed.
